# Test Plan for Airflow API Health Check  
   
## Objective  
The objective of this test plan is to verify that the Airflow API is up and running, and that each of its components is healthy and receiving heartbeats within the last 30 seconds.  
   
## Scope  
This test plan covers the following components of the Airflow API:  
- Metadatabase  
- Scheduler  
- Triggerer  
- DAG Processor  
   
## Preconditions  
- The Airflow API is installed and running on a server.  
- The server is accessible via network.  
- The API URL is available.  
   
## Test Cases  
   
### Test Case 1: Check API Health  
- **Description:** Verify that the Airflow API is up and running and all components are healthy.  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Send a GET request to the health endpoint.  
  2. Verify that the response status code is 200.  
  3. Verify that each Airflow component is reported as healthy.  
  4. Verify that each Airflow component's last heartbeat was received less than 30 seconds ago.  
- **Expected Result:** The Airflow API is up and running and all components are healthy.  
   
## Test Data  
- API URL: `airflow_api_url`  
   
## Test Environment  
- Python 3.7 or higher.  
- `pytest-bdd` library installed.  
- `requests` library installed.  
   
## Test Execution  
1. Set the `airflow_api_url` variable to the URL of the Airflow API.  
2. Navigate to the project directory.  
3. Execute the following command in the terminal:  
```  
pytest features/airflow_api_health.feature  
```  
4. Verify that all test cases pass.  
   
## Test Reporting  
- Test results will be displayed in the terminal.  
- Test reports can be generated using the `pytest-html` plugin.
