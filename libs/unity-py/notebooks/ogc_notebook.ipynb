    "# Submitting jobs using the OGC API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OGC (\"Open Spatial Consortium\") Processes API (\"Abstract Program Interface\")](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/processes/) is an international specification for executing remote processing of Earth Science data. The user makes HTTP(s) requests to execute data processing on a remote server, passing all required information in JSON (\"JavaScript Object Notation\") format. The user can use the OGC API to register, execute, and interact with CWL (\"Common Workflow Language) defined [Airflow DAGs (\"Directed Acyclic Graph\")](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html) as OGC API processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to execute a CWL DAG using the `Unity-Py` Python client program which interfaces with the OGC Processes API. This can be used to execute any CWL workflow which invokes a science algorithm packaged as a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on process vs. job:** A process is equivalent to an Airflow DAG in the Unity sytem and describes an algorithm you wish to execute while a job is the execution of that process. A process may have many jobs executing at a single time while a job belongs to a single process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any compute environment: Local or in the cloud\n",
    "- This tutorial assumes you have deployed an OGC process to the OGC Processes API endpoint but covers briefly how to register (and deregister) a process at the end\n",
    "- This notebook uses the [Unity-Py](https://github.com/unity-sds/unity-monorepo/tree/main/libs/unity-py) library to interact with the OGC API\n",
    "- Unity environment (e.g., DEV, TEST, PROD) and venue (e.g., unity-sbg-dev, unity-emit-dev, unity-asips-int) names. See [this documentation](https://unity-sds.gitbook.io/docs/system-docs/architecture/deployments-projects-and-venues/unity-owned-venues) for guidance\n",
    "- Unity username and password\n",
    "- A URL for the OGC API processes endpoint, something like: `https://unity-dev-httpd-alb-XXXXXXXXXX.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com:1234/unity/dev/ogc/`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- List all processes that have been registered at the OGC endpoint URL\n",
    "- Get details on a single process\n",
    "- Execute a job\n",
    "- Monitor a job\n",
    "- Get all jobs executing for a process\n",
    "- Delete a job"
